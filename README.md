# SinglyLinkedList

Create a singly linked list that has the next operations:
Create a new singly linked list
Get the first node
Add a node at the end of the singly linked list
Print full singly linked list
Consider the creation of a node class to hold data and the next node. For sake of simplicity, set data as int data type.
For the node class, implement the next operations:
Create a new node with data: the constructor method
Set next node: assign next with setter method
Unset next node
Set data
Follow the next recommendations to keep this exercise as simple as possible:
Don’t use build tools like Gradle or Maven 
Don’t use a complex directory tree
Keep package name simple
Create different files for every class:
Main program
Singly linked list
Node
